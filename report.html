        <h1>Reflecation of module Experience</h1>
        <p>In this section, I will discuss my experiences of learning web development and the positives and challanges I encountered while learning HTML and CSS.</p>
        <h2>How did I find this Module</h2>
        <p>Creating my portfolio website has been an exciting and rewarding journey. As a Computer Science student at the University of Northampton, I wanted to design a website that not only showcases my skills but also reflects my personality and passion for technology.I also learned a lot about grid layouts and CSS animations to make my website both structured and engaging.Overall, this project has been a great learning experience, helping me sharpen my technical skills, creativity, and attention to detail.</p>
        <h2>Design decisions</h2>
        <p>I used few of the website to get inspired for home page layout I took idea of this website navigation bar</p>
